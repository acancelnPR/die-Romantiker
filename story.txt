Once upon a time, there was a girl on Hauptstrasse driving a BMW to go and see Rammstein.
At that same time, someone walking their Hund across the Hauptstrasse started scrolling on their phone. They were not paying attention.
The driver of the BMW saw the Hund walker at the last minute and swerved to avoid. The car crashed into a biergarten.
A biergarten I was planning on visiting after the Rammstein concert! The concert was great, but now I am hungry for Brot.
I went to the Baeckerei in search of brot, but they were out! I got Apfelkuchen instead, and it was delicious. Afterwards, I tried to remember if I had left the Klimaanlage turned on while I drove to my house in Berlin.
While I was lost in thought about my klimaanlage, I almost crashed into a Porche!
As I regained focus and slammed the brakes, my Schloss Eltz miniature fell off the dashboard, but I managed to come to a stop just in time.
Shaken, I pulled over near a Ratskeller and tried to calm down,
After calming down at the Ratskeller, I noticed a group of tourists wearing traditional Dirndel and Lederhose, taking photos near the Schloss entrance.

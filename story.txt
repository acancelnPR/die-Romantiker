Once upon a time, there was a girl on Hauptstrasse driving a BMW to go and see Rammstein. 
At that same time, someone walking their Hund across the Hauptstrasse started scrolling on their phone. They were not paying attention.
The driver of the BMW saw the Hund walker at the last minute and swerved to avoid. The car crashed into a biergarten.
A biergarten I was planning on visiting after the Rammstein concert! The concert was great, but now I am hungry for Brot.

Once upon a time, there was a girl on Hauptstrasse driving a BMW to go and see Rammstein. 
At that same time, someone walking their Hund across the Hauptstrasse started scrolling on their phone. They were not paying attention.
The driver of the BMW saw the Hund walker at the last minute and swerve to avoid. The car crashed into a biergarten.
